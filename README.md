# These scripts let you quickly set-up and use [gitinspector](https://github.com/ejwa/gitinspector/wiki/Documentation) with multiple student group repos

The first time you want to use the scripts, run `bash set-up` from your terminal. When prompted, add the list of repo urls to repo-urls.txt.

You can quickly pull down new student work, run gitinspector and open all results in the browser by running `bash quick-grade-script`.
